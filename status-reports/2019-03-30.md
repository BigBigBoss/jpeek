Release 0.28 (Metrics corrections)

Scope Status
* Metrics correction [35%]
* jpeek maven plugin [0%]
* jpeek CI server [0%]
* jpeek IntelliJ plugin [0%]

Issues:
* Lots of metrics correction tasks that must be fixed, so jpeek won't have any
 new feature soon.
* Project does not have REV members. Being a sandbox project cuts veteran
 members from taking part in project, but we don't have members with enough reputation to be revisors.
* A lot of project staff is on vacation or inactive. Opened an [issue](https://github.com/zerocracy/farm/issues/1971) in 0crat farm for helping with this

Risks
* Jpeek have a lot of metrics correcting tasks, which scares newbies and ends 
up not being resolved [2/7]
