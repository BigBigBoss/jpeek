Release 0.30.2 - released in 05/12/2019

Scope Status

1. Metrics correction [35%]
1. jpeek maven plugin [0%]
1. jpeek CI server [0%]
1. jpeek IntelliJ plugin [0%]

Issues:

1. Lots of metrics correction tasks that must be fixed, so jpeek won't have any new feature soon.
1. Project does not have REV members. Being a sandbox project cuts veteran members from taking part in project, but we don't have members with enough reputation to be revisors.
1. A lot of project staff is on vacation or inactive. Opened an issue in 0crat farm for helping with this

Risks

1. Jpeek have a lot of metrics correcting tasks, which scares newbies and ends up not being resolved [2/7]
